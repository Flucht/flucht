# flucht.github.io

Flucht is a data-headed research project for analysing the circumstances which refugees are trying to escape. Specifically, we focused on the economic and political factors affecting this phenomenon. Nobody is leaving their home under highly precarious circumstances for no reason. We invite everybody to explore our data on GitHub, or to visit our webpage for our visualisations and further information.
