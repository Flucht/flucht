          <p class="mbr-text pb-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
          In order to accomplish our research case, we collected data from different sources and re-used it to create our own dataset. We aimed at re-using datasets free of cognitive biases, prejudices and discriminations, fair and reliable, legally valid, relevant, consistent and accurate. Due to the variety of institutional sources we used this was not easy task. During the research and management of data we encountered some difficulties due mainly to legal and accessibility issues. The results of our research provide a global economic and political perspective towards the phenomenon of emigration, hopefully to be object of interest in the public domain.

            <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
              In order to manage the mash-up of different datasets, with different licenses we followed the Guidelines for Open Data provided by the EU. In accordance with these guidelines, we pursued the objective to make our research data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR).<br><br>
              <strong>Findable</strong>: the first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.
            </p>
            <ul class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
              <li>F1. <i>(Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier</i>: both the data we retrieved in the original datasets, the mashed up data and the metadata we created according to the DCAT-AP are compliant with this point, presenting URI.</li>
              <li>F2. <i>Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)</i>: we associated a rich amount of metadata compliant with the DCAT-AP specification, including not only all the mandatory classes with their respective mandatory properties but also some recommended and optional properties that were useful for our data.</li>
              <li>F3. <i>Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe</i>: for each dataset that is part of a catalogue and for our own dataset we associated to the metadata a unique identifier of the data described by means of the DCAT-AP optional property for datasets dct:identifier.</li>
              <li>F4. <i>(Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource</i>: All the data we used are identified by an URL that allows to access the source where they are registered. For the creation of the metadata associated with our data we used the DCAT-AP specification, whose aim is to enable a cross-data portal search for data sets and make public sector data better searchable across borders and sectors. Therefore, we can state that our (meta)data are registered in a searchable infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Accessible</strong>: once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.</p>
            <ul class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
              <li>A1. <i>(Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol</i>: All the data we collected and mashed up and the relative metadata are retrievable through the HTTP or its extension HTTPS. Moreover, we provided also an explicit and clear contact protocol in the metadata by means of the names and emails of the data and metadata providers.</li>
              <li>A1.1. <i>The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable</i>: HTTP and HTTPS are compliant with these characteristics.</li>
              <li>A1.2 <i>The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary</i>: The HTTP and HTTPS provide for authentication of the accessed website.</li>
              <li>A2. <i>Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available</i>: Metadata will remain accessible from the homepage of the website we created about the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Interoperable</strong>: the data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.</p>
            <ul class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
              <li>I1. <i>(Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation</i>: we used JSON for the representation of the mashed up data and RDF with the XML syntax to describe and structure the metadata.</li>
              <li>I2. <i>(Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles</i>: the annotation format we used allow to use machine-readable terms from any controlled vocabulary. We used the ISO standard vocabulary to represent nations, the Linked Open Data vocabulary specification called DCAT-AP. These vocabularies are documented and resolvable using globally unique and persistent identifiers.</li>
              <li>I3. <i>(Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data</i>: JSON and the RDF schema account for the data exchange and cross reference among metadata respectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Reusable</strong>: the ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.</p>
            <ul class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
              <li>R1. <i>Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes</i>: our data and metadata are described through a rich and vary series of labels including the date of collection and modification of the data, the licence, the publisher, the creator, their content.</li>
              <li>R1.1. <i>(Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license</i>: all data we used were released with the specification of the usage license except for those from the UNHCR and UCDP. License in specified for the dataset and respective metadata we created (Creative Common License CC BY 4.0).</li>
              <li>R1.2. <i>(Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance</i>: our project includes information about the provenance of data in a machine-readable format in the metadata codification. The website presents also a description of the workflow that led to your data.</li>
              <li>R1.3. <i>(Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards</i>: we used the ISO standard for geographic information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mbr-text pb-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The principles mentioned above include three types of entities: data, metadata and infrastructure. Given the analysis, we can state that our research data are almost 100% compliant with the FAIR principles, with the few exceptions due to the lack of license specification.<br><br>

              <strong>UNHCR</strong>:  the organization ensures that data on all persons of concern are timely, relevant, accurate and reliable, and subject to a regular process of quality control, based on systematic and comprehensive mechanisms.<br><br>
              <strong>WBG</strong>: the quality and integrity of the data produced by the World Bank is guaranteed by its Development Data Group, which adopts professional standards in the collection, compilation and dissemination of data. It should be noticed the World Bank’s effort in helping developing countries improving the efficiency of their national statistical systems, since most of the data come from the member countries’ systems.<br><br>
              <strong>GTD</strong>: in the <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">Global Terrorism Database codebook</a> we can read their engagement in prioritising information coming from high-quality sources. They assess that “in order for an event to be recorded in the GTD it must be documented by at least one such high-quality source.”. Moreover, they ensure the quality of the coded data and the adoption of several layers of quality control.<br><br>
              <strong>UCDP</strong>: <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ged/ged191.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset Codebook</a> for version 19.1 addresses quality assurance of their dataset. Quality is reached through a series of automated routines that assure the quality and reliability of the data published and its constant control.<br><br>
              <strong>EIU</strong>: The quality of the EIU-Democracy Indices Dataset v2, is guaranteed first by its creator, <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/" class="text-info" target="_blank">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, which carries meticulous analysis to create high-quality data and has a reputation as trusted business intelligence group. Second, the democracy index is calculated from a large and vary base, by using 60 indicators that represent different aspects of societies which are relevant for the appraisal of the democracy level.

                <strong>UNHCR</strong>: we could not find information about the licence, nor about the last data of modification, maintenance issues and the version of the data. Lack of attribution of license means to abandon data forever, which means that other companies can recopyright it.<br><br>
                <strong>WBG</strong>: the licence used is CC BY-4.0. The maintenance follows an annual base. We could not find information about the version, nor about the last date of modification, except for the data about national and ILO unemployment (September 2019).<br><br>
                <strong>CHC Insurance Services Ltd</strong>: for the publication of data concerning the domestic and international terrorist attacks, the CHC Insurance Services created a specific <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CHC_GTD_EULA_NonCommercialUser_2019_V1.5.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">Global Terrorism Database End User license Agreement</a>.

                <strong>UNHCR</strong>: since 2015, UNHCR has its own <a href="https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55643c1d4.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">Data Protection Policy</a>. Although the Data Protection Policy adopted some principles, such as the privacy by design and by default approach (GDPR Article 25) that are included in the GDPR, there is not an explicit declaration of full compliance with the GDPR.<br><br>
                <strong>WBG</strong>: according to The World Bank Group’s presentation about “<a href="https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/10-2018-05-25_-_44th_sio_meeting_-_gdpr_at_the_wbg.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">GDPR at the WBG</a>” (25th May 2018) their GDPR-compliant privacy program was not fully complying with GDPR in May of 2018. However, thanks to the support of external consultancy, they have drawn an implementation plan to carry a series of actions that will help them to reach full compliance with GDPR.<br><br>
                <strong>GTD</strong>: we take into consideration The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), which makes the GTD available, because its studies focus on the causes and consequences of terrorism not only in the United States but also all around the world.

            <p class="mbr-text pb-5 mbr-fonts-style display-7">How sustainable and bias-free are our data providers? <br><br>
              <strong>UNHCR</strong>: since 2008 the establishment and enforcement of an ethical culture has been pursued in the UNHCR through its Ethics Office, which is committed since then in providing the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct within the organisation. For example, the UNHCR excludes data entries which might reveal the identity of a person. This is mostly the case if there are less than four affected people in a country per year.<br><br>
              <strong>WBG</strong>: the World Bank Group applies the highest ethical standards in any task performed thanks to the coordination and promotion acted by the Group’s dedicated Ethics and Business Conduct Department (EBC), whose aim is also the development, besides the application, of ethical standards.<br><br>
              <strong>GTD</strong>: the GTD does not include information about terroristic events that are exclusively documented by biased or unreliable sources.

             The Flucht dataset contains datasets from catalogues concerning the push factors of refugees, i.e. the political or economical situation in the country of origin. The catalogue was created within a course at the University of Bologna and is not actively maintained, while the datasets used for this catalogue are maintained by the relative institutions. However, our scripts remain available and can be rerun at any time on new files. If somebody notices that one of our input files is available in a newer version, we would be glad to be informed about it in order to update our file with the automated script. Our scripts are licensed under CC 4.0. We invite the community to update our files and contribute the updated files to our <a href="https://github.com/Flucht/flucht.github.io" class="text-info" target="_blank">GitHub project</a>.

            In the page <a href="visualisations.html">Visualisation</a> the user can find some graphical representations that are thought to help them better understand the data we collected. There is a map visualisation which allows the user to select one among the economic and political aspects we analysed, and shows it both in the map and in the correspondent bar chart. By selecting a country in the map, the user can see the total value on the map, and the value year by year from 2008 to 2018 in the bar chart. In the Graphs section we made available a bubble chart representing the total number of displaced people per country between 2008 and 2018, and a graph allowing you to visualise two different aspects among the economic and political ones at the same time, in the form of bar or line chart.

             The aim of the project was to understand which one, if the economic or the political factors, has a major impact on the phenomenon of emigration around the world. In general, we can state that it depends on the country. There are some countries were the economic conditions are more relevant and some other countries where the political situation affects more the displacement.<br><br>
             <strong>A variegated world</strong>. For some countries, political factors might affect more the phenomenon of emigration. This can be deduced from a trend in increase in displaced people and decrease in democracy level, increase in death and wounded by terrorism, while increase of GDP per capita. For example, for Cuba our data shows an increasing emigration, while the democracy index is decreasing, the GDP is increasing and the unemployment rate is decreasing. Political factors could be more relevant than economic ones in this case. Another example with similar data pattern is Azerbaijan.<br>
             In other countries, economic factors could be a more relevant cause of emigration. This can be deduced from an increase in displaced people and increase in democracy level such as in Congo – the nation experienced a shrinking GDP since 2015.<br><br>
             <strong>Positive examples</strong>. C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire has successfully increased democracy and the GDP, and has decreased the unemployment, the total deaths and in the end the emigration rate. However, the country still has opportunity for further development.<br><br>
             <strong>Europe at the tail end</strong>. Talking in general terms, the countries which experienced a higher displacement of people between 2008 and 2018 are Colombia, Syria and Afghanistan. Europe is the continent which has been hardly affected by outgoing but rather by incoming migration – as a destination.<br><br>
             <strong>Paradox of low/high unemployment rates</strong>. By comparing the Unemployment Rate and the Constant Income per Capita we get confirmation of the paradox of low/high unemployment rates: paradoxically, low unemployment rates can disguise substantial poverty in a country, while high unemployment rates can occur in countries with a high level of economic development and low rates of poverty. In countries without unemployment or welfare benefits people eke out a living in vulnerable employment. In countries with well-developed safety networks workers can afford to wait for suitable or desirable jobs.<br><br>
             <strong>Correlation unequal causation</strong>. While our platform is an interesting tool for exploring various datasets visually, further research is always necessary to understand the complex causalities of the phenomenon. For example, in Ghana the constant GDP per capita and democracy are increasing, while also the unemployment and the emigration rate are increasing.<br><br>
             In conclusion, we may make available some visualisations to let users discover by themselves the situation of country of interest, but we emphasise that further research is required to understand causation.
